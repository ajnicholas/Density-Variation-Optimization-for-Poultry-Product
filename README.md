Density Variation Optimization for Poultry Product

Process Development Scientist | Microsintesis | June 2024

Objective

Led the assessment of density variations across two Nuvio Poultry products (USA and Canada) to optimize dosing and packaging for cost efficiency and improved product performance.

Data Analysis & Optimization

Trials & Density Measurement: Conducted trials to measure maximum and minimum density and mass variations for two product batches (USA_Nuvio_Poultry Lot MSP24001 and Canada_Nuvio_Poultry Lot MSP24002).

Compaction Analysis: Leveraged compaction analysis to determine the impact of product texture and air spaces on density, leading to findings that minimized over- and under-dosing.

Simulation of Real-Life Scenarios: Utilized real-life scenario simulations of transportation and handling to capture daily density fluctuations and their effects on product efficacy.

Scoop Size Optimization: Implemented a density variation model and scoop size reduction from 90ml to 80ml based on detailed data visualization and density analysis, reducing dosing variability by 15% and saving costs by 10%.

Optimization Outcomes

Improved Dosing Consistency: Demonstrated that reducing scoop size led to more accurate and consistent dosing, enhancing product reliability and reducing wastage.

Density Variation Calculator: Developed a Density Variation Calculator integrated with quality control systems to automate real-time adjustments, further improving packaging consistency.

COGS Enhancement: Applied findings to enhance COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) analysis, reducing production costs by preventing overdosing and ensuring the product delivered the correct dosage across varying conditions.
